The EIGamal Encryption algorithm methodâ€™s sole concept is to make it nearly impossible to calculate the encryption approach even if certain important information is known to the attacker. It is mainly concerned about the difficulty of leveraging the cyclic group to find the discrete logarithm.

With this, the program allows the user to enter a message, shows the g^a, g^k, and g^ak ciphers and then decrypts the original message.

This is coded using the python programming language and uses the EIGamal Encryption Method, Square and Multiply Algorith to generate large and random numbers and is valid using primality testing algorithms
